Welcome to David Meulenberg's coding portfolio.  There are 4 programs for your review, all coded in Python (+ Pygame for three of them.):

Wordle Programs (WordlePrograms folder)
    1.  Wordle Practice (WordlePractice.py) -- This is a clone of the popular NYTimes Wordle game.  In this version, however, you can play more than once a day--you can play as many times as you'd like.  The list of answer words came from the official Wordle game in late 2022.  Coded in Python, using Pygame for display.

    2.  Wordle Solver (wordle_solver.py) -- This is a command-line program that allows you to enter the current state of your Wordle game (dark gray letters, yellow letter, green letters), and then will give you a list of remaining possible answers.  

Sideways Shooter Games (sideways_shooter folder)

    1.  Target Practice (target_practice.py) -- Your rocket ship is shooting at a moving target.  Each time you hit the target, the target gets smaller, moves faster, and appears at a random distance from your ship.  Your goal is to hit 10 targets before missing 15 times. (Controls: up and down arrow to move, space bar to shoot.)

    2.  Sideways Shooter (sideways_shooter.py) -- Aliens are attacking!  Each successive wave of enemy aliens will be faster and more numerous.  (Controls: up and down arrow to move, space bar to shoot.)
